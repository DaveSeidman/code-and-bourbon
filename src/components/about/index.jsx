        Coding is a Science, but it's also an Art, and art can be painful. The point of this meetup
        is to get together and discuss the satisfying victories and embarrassing failures we
        encounter on our journey to becoming better coders.

        Alcohol is <u>not a requirement!</u> In fact the only beverages that are NOT permitted at
        this meetup are ones containing caffeine ☕️ This is the cool-down, the happy hour, the
        retrospective. It's a chance for us to collectively take a breath, make friends, and play
        nice.
