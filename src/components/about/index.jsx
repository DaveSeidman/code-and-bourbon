      <p>Coding is a Science, but it's also an Art, and art can be painful. The point of this meetup is to get together and discuss the satisfying victories and embarrassing failures we encounter on our journey to becoming better coders.</p>
      <p>Alcohol is <u>not a requirement!</u> In fact the only beverages that are NOT permitted at this meetup are ones containing caffeine ☕️ This is the cool-down, the happy hour, the retrospective. It's a chance for us to collectively take a breath, make friends, and play nice.</p>
